     <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>-Morocco is a country beautifully divided in art and architecture. <br>-In houses we find tiles with patterns of a variety of invigorating colors, traditional fountains in the heart of the living room, wrought iron stair railings, hand-woven Andalus rugs, suspended mosaic lamps, etc.<br>
-Moroccan craftsmanship is divided into four main traditional sectors which are wood, metals, textiles and leather. <br>
-With these resources, Moroccan craftsmen make pottery, weaving, brassware with copper, ironwork, leather goods, jewelry and embroidery with textiles. </p>
